## Inspiration & Credits 🌟
The development of the **Real Clock** mod was inspired by adverserath's ["Casual Life" mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6011).
Initially, some elements were adapted from "Casual Life" to support Stardew Valley 1.6. However, since **version 1.2.0**, the code was **fully rewritten from scratch**, making the mod completely independent.
