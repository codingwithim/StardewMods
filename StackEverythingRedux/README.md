# 📦 Stack Everything Redux for Stardew Valley 🌱

**Version:** 1.2.1

## Description:
**Stack Everything Redux** supercharges your item stacking experience in Stardew Valley! Say goodbye to clutter because now you can stack all sorts of items that normally don't stack, like **Furniture**, **Tackles**, and **Wallpapers**. Not only that, you can go beyond the default limit of 999 by customizing the max stack amount in the mod's settings.
— But wait, there's more! This mod also introduces a handy input method (**SHIFT+Right Click**) for easily selecting the amount you need when buying, crafting, cooking, or splitting stacked items. It's like magic for your inventory!

## Key Features 🌟
-   **Expanded Stacking Capability**: Stack items that are not stackable by default, including Furniture, Tackles, and Wallpapers. Decorative cacti are excluded to preserve their unique appearances.
-   **Modify Default Max Amount**: Customize the default maximum stack amount beyond 999 for improved item management.
-   **Enhanced Input Selection**: Adds a convenient input method (SHIFT+Right Click) to select desired amounts when buying, crafting, cooking, or splitting stacked items.
-   **Improved Tackle Handling**: Tackles now share durability correctly when stacked, and a new config (`EnableTackleSplit`) lets you disable tackle stacking if you prefer.
-   **Compatibility Fixes**: Improved behavior with shops, crafting/cooking, and chest menus (Better Chests supported).
-   **Localization**: Now includes Spanish (es) i18n for configuration options.

-   Override `StardewValley.Object.maximumStackSize` to allow stacking beyond 999.
-   Improve stacking behavior for Furniture, Tackles, and Wallpapers.
-   Handle tackle durability when stacked.
-   Add an input menu for splitting stacks, crafting, cooking, or shopping.

## Known Issues:
-   Certain items like tools, hats, rings, boots, and weapons remain unstackable due to technical constraints.
